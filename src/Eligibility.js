                 There is no prescribed age limit or qualification required for candidates to appear for GRE 2021, 
                 however, since GRE is an assessment test for admission to graduate courses, candidates are expected to have successfully completed their undergraduate program. 
                 Candidates should note that not all programs and universities require candidates to have a GRE score for admission to graduate programs. 
                 Whether a candidate requires to appear for his GRE is entirely at the discretion of the university and the course he is pursuing.
